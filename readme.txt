This project was part of my master's thesis. Much of the development is specific for motion correction in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) by tracking center of mass (COM). There is also some general utility for extracting information from Siemens PETLink and running Siemens e7_code from within python. 

The petlink module is based on Siemens c++ walkthroughs, and the interfile module is on my branch of Stefano Pedemonte's project. Stefano Pedemonte also provides a petlink module that complements the one found here. For more information, please see https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us/molecular-imaging/petlink-documents.

A great number of python notebooks was produced, were I imagine the results and module tests would have the most general interest.
