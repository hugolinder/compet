This python project is a part of my master's thesis. Much of the development is specific for motion correction in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) by tracking center of mass (COM). There is also some general utility for extracting information from Siemens PETLink data and running Siemens e7_code from within python. 

In the python source folder, the petlink module is based on Siemens c++ walkthroughs. The interfile module is on my branch of Stefano Pedemonte's project. Please see https://github.com/spedemon, where Stefano Pedemonte also provides a petlink module that complements mine. For more PETLink information, please see https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us/molecular-imaging/petlink-documents.

I recommend the reader to start with the python source modules, which are also described in 'details.txt'. A great number of python notebooks was produced, were I imagine the results and module tests would have the most general interest, demonstrating use of the python modules.
