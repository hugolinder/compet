This python project is a part of my master's thesis. It performs event-by-event motion correction in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) by tracking center of mass (COM). There is also general utility for extracting information from Siemens PETLink data and running Siemens e7tools from within python. 

In the python source folder, the petlink module is based on Siemens c++ walkthroughs. The interfile module is on my branch of Stefano Pedemonte's project. Please see https://github.com/spedemon, where Stefano Pedemonte also provides an alternative petlink module. For more PETLink information, please see https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us/molecular-imaging/petlink-documents.

I recommend the reader to start with the python source modules, which are also described in 'details.txt'. A great number of python notebooks was produced, were I imagine the results and module tests would have the most general interest, demonstrating use of the python modules in a relatively clean way.
